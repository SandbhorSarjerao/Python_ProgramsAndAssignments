####### Go to any directory in your laptop or desktop and create the above folder structure. After creating the above folder structure include the following code in respective files.
# student.py
class Student:

   def __init__(self, student):
      self.name = student['name']
      self.gender = student['gender']
      self.year = student['year']

   def get_student_details(self):
      return f"Name: {self.name}\nGender: {self.gender}\nYear: {self.year}"


# faculty.py
class Faculty:

   def __init__(self, faculty):
      self.name = faculty['name']
      self.subject = faculty['subject']

   def get_faculty_details(self):
      return f"Name: {self.name}\nSubject: {self.subject}"
      
      
      
      
      
##### We have the above in the student.py and faculty.py files. Let's create another file to access those classed inside it. Now, inside the package directory create a file named testing.py and include the following code.
# testing.py
# importing the Student and Faculty classes from respective files
from student import Student
from faculty import Faculty

# creating dicts for student and faculty
student_dict = {'name' : 'John', 'gender': 'Male', 'year': '3'}
faculty_dict = {'name': 'Emma', 'subject': 'Programming'}

# creating instances of the Student and Faculty classes
student = Student(student_dict)
faculty = Faculty(faculty_dict)

# getting and printing the student and faculty details
print(student.get_student_details())
print()
print(faculty.get_faculty_details())



######## Copy the above student code and place it here. Now, let's see how to access it in the testing.py file. Add the following in the testing.py file.
# testing.py
from student.main import Student

# creating dicts for student
student_dict = {'name' : 'John', 'gender': 'Male', 'year': '3'}

# creating instances of the Student class
student = Student(student_dict)

# getting and printing the student details
print(student.get_student_details())
